Hi, I'm Ben Crouse, a software developer based in Richmond, Virginia. I'm passionate about building high-quality software and exploring new technologies.

On this site, I share my thoughts and experiences about software development, programming languages, cloud technologies, and best practices. My blog posts cover topics ranging from functional programming to cloud architecture, with practical examples and real-world applications.

When I'm not coding, I enjoy learning about new development paradigms and contributing to the developer community through writing and sharing knowledge.

Feel free to check out my [blog](/blog/) for my latest posts or view my [CV](/cv/) to learn more about my professional experience.
