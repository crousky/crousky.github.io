# Notes:
# - This workflow builds the site with Jekyll (using the repository Gemfile). It creates a
#   new release on every run (a timestamped tag) and attaches `site.zip` containing the
#   generated `_site` folder.
# - The built site can be downloaded from the Release page.
# - The workflow uses the built-in `GITHUB_TOKEN` so no additional secrets are required to
#   create releases. If you prefer to use a different token with wider permissions, add
#   it as a repository secret and replace `secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN` above.
